Otherwise, you need to install `selenium` with pip.

## Installing web drivers

Download here:
 - [Chromedriver](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver)
 - [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) (Firefox)


On Mac, you can use Homebrew to install web drivers from the command line:

```sh

```

```sh
brew install --cask chromedriver
```
